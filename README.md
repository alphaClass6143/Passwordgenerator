# passwordgenerator
This is a passwordgenerator. Passwords generated in this program are not saved.
It's capable of saving user defined settings and has a small and modern GUI.

It has mainly been a learning project for myself with a focus on the following objectives:
- Learning how to use the Preferences API in Java (The main goal was to learn saving settings from a user without the use of an extra file)
- Learning how to support multiple languages in a program
- Improving project structuring and code documentation (There is still some room for Improvement for that one)
- General improvement of the coding quality and coding knowledge

This program and it's source code is free to use for anybody.
Alter it, use it for your own projects or improve it. Do as you wish!
